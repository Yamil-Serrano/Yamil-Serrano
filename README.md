## My Passion & Focus:

I’m deeply passionate about robotics, video game design, and system development, and I enjoy working on projects that blend software and hardware. I’m always excited to collaborate on technical and academic initiatives, especially within my university community.
Currently, my main focus is on computer architecture and digital electronics. I enjoy exploring how computers work internally, from designing digital components to programming in assembly and understanding how software interacts with hardware at a fundamental level.
My goal is to build innovative systems that merge hardware and software in a meaningful way, developing efficient and well-structured solutions with real-world impact.

I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate, learn, and push the boundaries of technology with others who share similar interests.
